# pyTorchBasis
 
This portfolio is intended to showcase my training in PyTorch, which ranges from basic tutorials to advanced models.

## Contents

- **Basic tutorials and examples**: Introduction to PyTorch, linear regression, softmax classification, neural network basics, MNIST digit classification, and data loading and processing techniques.
- **Intermediate projects**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transfer learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), autoencoders, sequence-to-sequence models, and image augmentation techniques.
- **Advanced projects (WIP!)**: Custom layers and modules, reinforcement learning, advanced GANs, attention mechanisms, graph neural networks (GNNs), natural language processing (NLP), model optimization and quantization, time series forecasting, and model deployment.

Each project includes Jupyter notebooks for ease of use.
