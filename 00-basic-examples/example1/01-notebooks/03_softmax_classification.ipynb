    "## Understanding softmax classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax classification is a critical method in machine learning and data analysis, primarily used for categorizing input data into multiple classes. Unlike linear regression, which predicts a continuous output, softmax classification aims to assign probabilities to each class, allowing the model to classify input data into the most likely category."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Key concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Binary vs. multiclass classification\n",
    "- **Binary classification**: Involves two possible output classes. The model predicts which of the two classes the input data belongs to.\n",
    "- **Multiclass classification**: Involves more than two output classes. The model assigns a probability to each class and classifies the input data based on the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. The softmax function\n",
    "The softmax function is a generalization of the logistic function that squashes the outputs of each class into a range between 0 and 1, representing probabilities, and ensures that the sum of all probabilities equals 1. It is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{softmax}(z_i) = \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ z_i $ is the raw output (logits) of the model for class $ i $, and $ K $ is the total number of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Model parameters\n",
    "Softmax classification models consist of weights (coefficients) and biases. The weights represent the relationship between each input feature and each class, while the biases account for the base probability of each class when all input features are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Assumptions of softmax classification\n",
    "For softmax classification to be effective, several assumptions should be considered:\n",
    "- **Independence of input features**: The features should be independent of each other.\n",
    "- **Adequate data representation**: The input data should adequately represent all classes to avoid bias in classification.\n",
    "- **No multicollinearity**: Features should not be highly correlated, as this can lead to redundancy and affect model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Model evaluation\n",
    "Evaluating the performance of a softmax classification model involves various metrics, including:\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.\n",
    "- **Precision, recall, and F1 score**: Metrics that provide insights into the performance of the model for each class, particularly in cases of imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "- **Confusion matrix**: A table that shows the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative predictions, helping to visualize the performance of the classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Overfitting and underfitting\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: Occurs when the model learns the noise and specific details of the training data, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data. This usually happens when the model is too complex.\n",
    "- **Underfitting**: Happens when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Regularization\n",
    "Regularization techniques help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the model's complexity. Common methods include:\n",
    "- **L2 regularization (Ridge)**: Adds a penalty proportional to the square of the coefficients, discouraging large coefficients and thus, reducing model complexity.\n",
    "- **L1 regularization (Lasso)**: Adds a penalty proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients, which can lead to sparsity in the model, meaning some coefficients may be exactly zero, simplifying the model."

    "### Maths\n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax classification is a key method in machine learning, particularly useful for multi-class classification problems where an input is assigned to one of multiple classes. Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous values, softmax classification predicts probabilities for each class and assigns the input to the class with the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. The softmax function\n",
    "\n",
    "The softmax function converts raw scores (logits) from a neural network into probabilities that sum to one. It is defined as:\n",
    "$$ \\text{softmax}(z_i) = \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}} $$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ z_i $ is the raw score (logit) for class $ i $.\n",
    "- $ K $ is the total number of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Model formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In softmax classification, the model predicts the probability of each class. For an input $ \\mathbf{x} $ with features $ x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n $, the model can be written as:\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b} $$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ \\mathbf{z} $ is the vector of raw scores (logits) for each class.\n",
    "- $ \\mathbf{W} $ is the weight matrix, with each row corresponding to the weights for a specific class.\n",
    "- $ \\mathbf{b} $ is the bias vector.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 3. The objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of training a softmax classifier is to find the weights and biases that maximize the likelihood of the observed data. This is typically done by minimizing the cross-entropy loss between the predicted probabilities and the true class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. The cross-entropy loss\n",

    "- $ \\hat{y_i} $ is the predicted probability of class $ i $ obtained from the softmax function.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 5. Minimizing the cost function\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the optimal weights $ \\mathbf{W} $ and biases $ \\mathbf{b} $, we minimize the cross-entropy loss using gradient descent or other optimization algorithms. The gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases are computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the weights:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial W_{jk}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\hat{y_{ik}} - y_{ik}) x_{ij} $$\n",
