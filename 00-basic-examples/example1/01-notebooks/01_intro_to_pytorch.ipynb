    "Welcome to the `01_intro_to_pytorch` notebook. This is part of a portfolio designed to showcase foundational PyTorch concepts and techniques that will be utilized in later projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I cover essential topics such as setting up the environment, working with tensors, leveraging GPU acceleration, and implementing automatic differentiation. Through various exercises, this notebook will show how to create and manipulate tensors, build and train simple neural networks, and evaluate model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook lays the groundwork for more advanced PyTorch applications in subsequent projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, keep in mind that these notebooks following a \"question-and-answer\" format for active learning training purposes. So instead of just having explanatory code I'd rather go and and try to actively recall (or look up) the answer to a problem I face, which could as simple as loading libraries, to more complex things such as how to fine-tune models."

    "\n",
    "PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It provides a flexible and intuitive platform for building and training neural networks. \n",
    "PyTorch's key features include dynamic computation graphs, which allow for more efficient model building and debugging, and support for GPU acceleration, enabling faster computations. \n",
    "\n",
    "With its extensive library of tools and utilities, PyTorch is widely used for both research and production in machine learning and artificial intelligence projects. These projects include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Building models for text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.\n",
    "- **Computer vision**: Implementing image classification, object detection, and image generation tasks.\n",
    "- **Reinforcement learning**: Developing algorithms for game playing and decision-making processes.\n",
    "- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Creating realistic images, videos, and other data generation tasks.\n",
    "- **Time series analysis**: Forecasting and anomaly detection in sequential data.\n",
    "- **Speech recognition**: Building models for converting speech to text and vice versa.\n",
    "- **Robotics**: Developing intelligent control systems for robotic movements and actions.\n",
    "- **Healthcare**: Predictive modeling and medical image analysis for diagnostics and treatment planning."
